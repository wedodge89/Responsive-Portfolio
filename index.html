    <img id="headshot" src="https://github.com/wedodge89/Basic-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/wetransfer-70b7db/_DSC2491.jpg?raw=true" width="200" height="300" alt="Elliott Dodge">
    <p>My name is Elliott Dodge. I am a full-stack developer in training. While I currently work as a writer for a faith-based non-profit, I am excited to learn more about and explore the world of technology. I am eager to address real-world problems using web design and coding to create innovative solutions.</p>

    <p>When I'm not working, I pass the time either playing games of all sorts (video, board, card, yard, etc.) and/or hanging out with my awesome wife and baby girl.</p>
    
    <p>I have experience working with technology, primarily on the hardware side. For almost a decade, I have worked running live sound for various events, from groups of about 10 up to more than 100. I have also independently studied IT, with an interest in pursuing IT certifications at some point.</p>
